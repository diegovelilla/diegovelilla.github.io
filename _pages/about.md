Hi there Qty, if you somehow ended up here don't leave just yet, don't be rude and let me introduce myself. 

My name is Diego and I like AI. Quick and easy. I'm starting this blog/website/idk to post articles about my open source projects, new things I learn or I find interesting, or any other tech related stuff.

The main point is to give back by explaining the work done in every project, making it **as engaging as possible** (yes tiktok has also given me irreversible dopamine receptor damage), while also consolidating does learnings by writing everything down. Kinda like batman but without PEDs.

Any feedback is welcomed, except bad feedback 'cause that makes me sad. Literally me -> :(

Hope you enjoy my posts.
