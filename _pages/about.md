Hi there Qty, if you somehow ended up here don't leave just yet, don't be rude and let me introduce myself. 

My name is Diego and I like AI. Quick and easy. I'm starting this blog/website/idk to post articles about my open source projects, new things I learn or I find interesting, or any other tech related stuff.

The main point is to consolidate learnings by writing everything down while also giving back by explaining the work done in every project. Kinda like batman but without PEDs. I'll try my best to make it **as engaging as possible** (yes tiktok has also given me irreversible dopamine receptor damage) so that you consider taking up reading again. 

Any feedback is welcomed, except bad feedback 'cause that makes me sad. Literally me -> :(

Hope you enjoy my posts.
